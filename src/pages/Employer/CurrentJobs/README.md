## 🎯 Key Differences Between Pages

| Feature | Current Jobs | Work History |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Status Badge | None | Green "Completed" |
| Action Buttons | Chat, See More, Rate, Complaint | Chat, Profile |
| Date Display | "Since X days" | "Completed X days ago" + exact date |
| Rating Display | Shows rating button or "Rated" | Shows employer rating given |
| Modal | Job Details Modal | None |

---

## 📝 Notes

- Chat functionality is UI-only (button present, no implementation)
- Raise Complaint is UI-only (button present, no implementation)
- Success Rate is hardcoded (92% current, 98% history)
- Description field handles both object (`description.text`) and string formats
- All API calls use `withCredentials: true` for session management
- Environment variable `VITE_BACKEND_URL` used for API base URL
- Default fallback to `http://localhost:9000` if env var not set

---

## 🔒 Authentication

All routes require:
- Active session (`req.session.user`)
- Employer role (`req.session.user.role === "Employer"`)
- Returns 401/403 if unauthorized

---

## ✨ Animations & Styling

### Modal Animations
```css
- Overlay: fade in/out (220ms / 180ms)
- Panel: slide up with scale (260ms / 180ms)
- Backdrop blur: 4px
- Easing: cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1)
```

### Card Hover Effects
```css
- Border color: gray → blue
- Transform: translateY(-2px)
- Shadow: elevation increase
```

### Button Styles
- Primary: Blue gradient
- Secondary: Gray
- Danger: Red (Raise Complaint)
- Success: Yellow (Rate Freelancer)
- Disabled: Opacity 50%

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Chat feature is placeholder only
2. Raise Complaint feature is placeholder only
3. Success rate is not dynamically calculated
4. Profile navigation assumes route exists
5. No pagination (shows all freelancers)

---

## 🎁 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement real chat functionality
- [ ] Add complaint filing system
- [ ] Calculate success rate from data
- [ ] Add pagination for large lists
- [ ] Export work history to PDF
- [ ] Filter by date range
- [ ] Sort by rating, date, name
- [ ] Add freelancer performance graphs
